Welcome to 'Technical Evolution' â€“ evolving technical knowledge and trade craft.

I'm Simon, I'm currently working as a Principal Threat Hunter at WithSecure.

My day to day generally involves security research, detection engineering and conducting intrusion analysis.

<br>
I'll be using this blog to cover a variety of personal research topics.
As such, all analysis and findings are strictly for educational purposes.
