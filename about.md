Welcome to 'Technical Evolution' â€“ a voyage, evolving technical knowledge and trade craft.

I'm Simon currently working as a Senior Threat Hunter.
My day to day generally involves security research, detection engineering and conducting intrusion analysis.

I'll be using this blog to cover a variety of personal research topics.
