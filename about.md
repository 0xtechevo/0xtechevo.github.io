Welcome to 'Technical Evolution' â€“ a voyage to evolving technical knowledge and understanding.

My name is Simon and I currently work as a Senior Threat Hunter, creating detection rules and conducting intrusion analysis.

Thanks for checking out my blog, where I aim to explore various computer security related topics, 
expanding my knowledge and hopefully yours too.

If you have any constructive feedback, feel free to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/techevo_)
